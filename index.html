<h1>Digital Humanities Portfolio</h1>

<p>My name is Aaliyah Rhame, and I am a senior at the University of Central Florida majoring in Film with a minor in Digital Media. Through my coursework and short film projects, I have developed strong skills in video editing, motion graphics, and audio post-production using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition. I also have experience in color correction, media management, and creating content optimized for social media platforms. My background has allowed me to work both independently and collaboratively, preparing me to contribute effectively in professional production environments.</p>
