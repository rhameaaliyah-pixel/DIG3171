<h1>My name is Aaliyah Rhame. I am a senior at the University of Central Florida majoring in Film with a minor in Digital Media. Through my coursework and short film projects, I have gained strong skills in video editing, motion graphics, and audio post-production using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Audition. I also have experience with color correction, media management, and creating content tailored for social media platforms. My background has allowed me to work both independently and collaboratively, preparing me to contribute effectively in professional production environments.<h1>

<h2>Why Github? </h2>  
    <p>This is just one more skill that can help you stand out in the job market! There is a big push for technical documents to be treated as code–and even to write them in the same software as code–for software and technical companies. Plus, Github pages use Markdown, which is another impressive skill for your resume.
    </p>
<h2>Quickstart</h2>
<ol>
<li> Fork (copy) <a href="https://github.com/ekjphd/DIG3171">This whole Repository</a>, then you can just edit the content with your own work, creating your own portfolio!
<li> <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/f082453c-cde9-489e-b412-801d641884e5">Start here for Github basics</a>
<li> index.html = your site's home page
<li> You can edit the HTML files directly on GitHub.
<li> "Commit" means save. Don’t forget to save!
<li> Preview is a great way to check before saving.
<li> After you click “commit changes…” it will ask you to describe your changes. It will auto-fill this, so feel free to just click “commit changes” and not worry about notes about what you did.
<li> Make any changes you’d like to show off your coding skills!
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create or Edit Files</h2>
<li> To create a new file, click the “Add file” button and select “Create new file”.
<li> To edit an existing file, navigate to the file and click the pencil icon (✏️) in the top right corner of the file view.
<li> Make Your Changes
<li> Use the GitHub editor to make your changes. You can write and edit Markdown files directly in the browser.
<li> Save Your Changes
<li> After making your changes, scroll down to the “Commit changes” section.
<li> It will ask you for a commit message describing your changes, but you can just accept the auto-generated description (this is not a big deal).
<li> Make sure “Commit directly to the main branch” is chosen (it should be by default) and click “Commit changes.”
  </li>
