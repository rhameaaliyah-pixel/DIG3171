# My Final Research Project  

Project: Curated Selves

# Abstract

My Twine project, Curated Selves, examines how social media platforms influence digital identity and self-image. The interactive story allows users to make choices that reflect typical online activities to show how digital environments change authenticity into performance. Through interactive storytelling, users navigate choices that mirror how individuals curate their digital selves to maintain an image or seek validation (Marwick). These performances, while often framed as expressions of individuality, are shaped by algorithms and audience expectations that reward relatability and visibility (Abidin). This project also investigates how technology creates both connection and isolation, as users feel pressured to appear genuine while filtering their lives for approval (Turkle). In analyzing these behaviors, the project reflects on the paradox of online authenticity, that the more one tries to appear real, the more constructed that image becomes. By engaging users in these digital decisions, this project highlights how performance, identity, and technology continue to blur in the age of constant visibility (Rettberg). Ultimately, this project calls attention to the paradox of authenticity in the digital era, showing that as users strive to appear real online, they often move further from the truth of self-expression (Boyd).
