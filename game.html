 <h1> Abstract </h1>
<p>
<em>Rather Be Alone</em> is an interactive Twine narrative that explores how human relationships have increasingly become mediated through digital communication. The story places players in emotionally complex situations, allowing them to choose between texting, video calling, or withdrawing entirely. Each decision leads to one of four endings—Authenticity, Digital Comfort, Loneliness, or Balance—reflecting the nuanced outcomes of online intimacy. Drawing from Sherry Turkle’s <em>Alone Together</em> (2011) and Jenna Wortham’s “Love in the Time of Tinder” (2018), this project examines the paradox of modern connection: how technology simultaneously fosters closeness and isolation. By using interactivity, <em>Connections</em> transforms scholarly perspectives on digital communication into personal, emotional experiences that challenge players to consider what authenticity means in a virtual world.
